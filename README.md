## Winter Semester 2022/23 -- Assignment 1

1. (From GTG, R-1.1.) Write a short Python function, `is_multiple(n,m)`, that takes two integer values and returns `True` if $n$ is a multiple of $m$, i.e., if $n=mi$ for some integer $i$, and `False` otherwise.

2. (From GTG, R-1.2.)  Write a short Python function, `is_even(k)`, that takes an integer value and returns `True` if $k$ is even, and `False` otherwise. However, your function cannot use the multiplication, modulo, or division operators.

3. Write a function `sum_of_first_integers(n)`, using a `for` loop, to compute the sum of the first $n$ positive integers.

4. A number is a palindrome if the $i$-th decimal digit from the front coincides  with the $i$-th decimal digit from the back.  E.g., 18781 is a palindrome, whereas 84736 is not.  Write a function `is_palindrome(n)` that returns `True` if $n$ is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.
